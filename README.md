processing-sketches
===================

My sketches for [Processing](http://processing.org) programming language.

There are some sketches in Processing Examples,
which do the same thing, but I created my own slightly fancier version,
just for fun.
I do not expect you to appreciate that. :)

Contents
--------

 * **Audio**
     * **Piano** - Electronic piano.
 * **Cellular Automata**
     * **Elementary Cellular Automata** - 
       One dimensional elementary cellular automata, as described
       by Stephen Wolfram in his book [A new kind of science](http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/)
       (state of cell in next iteration depends on state of cell and its
       left and right neighbour in current iteration,
       thus we have 256 of elementary CAs).
     * **Game Of Life**
 * **L-Systems**
     * **DragonCurve** -
     [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system#Example_7:_Dragon_curve)
     * **FractalPlant** -

 * **Other**
     * **AsProceduralAsPossible** - CD cover for album of algorithmically generated music [As Procedural As Possible](http://soundcloud.com/myownclone/sets/as-procedural-as-possible-2/) of my buddy MyOwnClone (his [GitHub](https://github.com/MyOwnClone), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/MyOwnClone)).
